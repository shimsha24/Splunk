### Machine data: 
Machine data refers to the digital information generated by various systems, devices, and applications as they operate. This data is typically produced by machines, sensors, and software applications, and it can include logs, metrics, events, and other performance-related information. 

Common sources of machine data include:
- Servers and Network Devices: Logs from web servers, firewalls, routers, and switches.
- Applications: Application logs that capture user interactions, errors, and system performance.
- IoT Devices: Data from connected devices, such as sensors and smart appliances.
- Databases: Logs that track queries, transactions, and performance metrics.
- Operating Systems: System logs that monitor activity, resource usage, and security events.

Machine data is often analyzed to gain insights into system performance, troubleshoot issues, enhance security, and improve operational efficiency. Tools like Splunk are commonly used to collect, analyze, and visualize this type of data.

- Machine data is difficult to analyse and visualise because it is not in a structured format.And also it is not efficient and fast for analysis.
  ### Logs:
  - Series of messages in time sequence that will describe activities going with system
 
  ### Log analysis:
  - Process or reviewing and understanding the computer genereated records.
